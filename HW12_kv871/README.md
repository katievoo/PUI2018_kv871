## Assignment 1: 

In assignment one we used the array from last week with mta information on station and # of swipes by card type for a period of 194 weeks. We used a Fourier Transformation to identify periodicity. I had to drop nans from my array first. We then found the four stations with the most periodicity (or "power"), and graphed those. Something went wrong here as I had one line so far above the rest that you couldn't see the other 3, which did not look like my other classmates'. 

I received help from Professor Bianco on manipulating my array and graphing the fourier transformation. I also received some help from Pablo with the concepts. Nathan C. helped me with the last part- finding the four stations with the most periodicity.


## Assignment 2: 

In assignment 2 we compiled many years of census data on the # of businesses per zip code. I used a for loop to read these in programmatically. Then we standardized the data and used k-means clustering to identify 5 clusters. Then we plotted the timeseries for each cluster and a cloropleth of NYC zipcodes shaded to reflect clusters. Then we tried agglomerative clustering, which produced clusters that were less evenly distributed (most zipcodes were in one cluster). 

I worked collaboratively with Max B. on this assignment. Linda J. had already completed the assignment and gave me helpful pointers along way. For instance she told me that I needed to make all my 'zip' columns lower case and showed me how to plot the timeseries with a for loop to create a plot for each cluster. She also pointed me to helpful notebooks in the UINOTEBOOKS repository.
