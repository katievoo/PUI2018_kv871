Assignment 1: 

I received help from Professor Bianco on manipulating my array and graphing the fourier transformation. I also received some help from Pablo with the concepts. Nathan C. helped me with the last part- finding the four stations with the most periodicity.


Assignment 2: 

I worked collaboratively with Max B. on this assignment. Linda J. had already completed the assignment and gave me helpful pointers along way. For instance she told me that I needed to make all my 'zip' columns lower case and showed me how to plot the timeseries with a for loop to create a plot for each cluster. She also pointed me to helpful notebooks in the UINOTEBOOKS repository.
