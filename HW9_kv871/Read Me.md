**Assignment 2** 

I received help from Christine Biddlecomb on #1. Christine helped me fix the function definition and trouble shoot my graph. She suggested I use a smaller number in the linspace() function so that I could see each point and its error bars. She also suggested that I define x y and error(e) in an earlier cell to simplify my application of the line function. She also helped me with defining and printing the sm.add_constant function. She also pointed me to the Lab 8 github repository for more guidance on lines. 

Iylas helped me understand what the sm.add_constant function was doing, and why it might be necessary for the OLS regression. 

Eve M. helped me understand that the model that used the sm.add_constant had a different (and more accurate) slope than the model that used x and y. 

Eve M. and Nathan also showed me what their graphs looked like for #4, but I did not look at their code for the graphs.
